# Windows Keyboard Shortcut Extender

This is a small utility that I wrote for my own use a few years ago. It allows special characters to be typed more easily than with the methods baked into Windows (numpad code point entry, keyboard layout toggling).

Due to a few minor bugs that never really bothered me until now, I plan to resume maintenance on it. This is a project that I started when I was in middle school, so it is still something of a mess. Expect nothing.

I am not affiliated with Microsoft in any way. This is a utility that only makes sense on Windows and uses the Windows API, thence the name.
